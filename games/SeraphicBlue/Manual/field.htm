  The field map is an enlarged version of the world map, and where players can move from one point to another. Different places are represented by their different structures on the field map. Random enemy encounters can occur while moving on the field, and that the enemy encounter rate changes depending on the terrains that players move across (Grassland, Forests, Wasteland etc...) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The bottom right of the screen above shows the mini version of the world map in sem-transparent form. <br>
The red dot on the world map indicates your current location, while the fading-in-and-out white dots indicate the locations of towns and villages. Dungeons are not indicated on the world map. <br>
<br>
At certain points in the game where the game undergoes new events and changes resulting in new places and such, the locations of these places will be hidden from the world map. <br>
 Players will hence have to search for these places themselves. (If you're lost, you can always check the Destination section under <a href="dictonary.htm">Dictionary</a> to check your next destination.)

  At a certain stage of the game, players will have access to flying around the field map in an airship.
<br>
 Any character can call for an airship as players will be steering (moving) the airship 
itself once they have control over it. <br>
Players can call for the airship from only flat terrains (Flatland, Grassland and Wasteland) by pressing Enter. The airship will pick you up and you are then ready to steer the airship. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Players can enter the interiors of the airship while the airship is flying by pressing Esc. As a result, players cannot call for the Main Menu while the airship is flying on the field map. They can, however, call for the Main Menu when they are inside the airship. <br>
  Players can chat with other party members while in the airship.
<br>
 Talk to any one of the two pilots (facing the computers as shown in the picture above) to get back to steering the airship.

<p><font size="2">The Roanoke is a medium-sized goods transportation airship. Despite it being second-hand and inexpensive, the airship is made of a very strong and durable material and has basic weaponry equipped to it. <br>
  Being one of the best airships with excellent maneuvering, the Roanoke does have great functionalities and is far from being merely a show-off. <br>
Anyone who has the chance to view the Roanoke will be blown away by its huge and majestic appearance, despite it being only medium</font>-sized.</p>
