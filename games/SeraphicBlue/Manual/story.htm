<p>- Evils...</p>

<p>Known to men as black-winged demons. </p>

<p>Besides having black wings, they are also physically bigger and stronger than the ordinary humans. </p>

<p>These demons appeared out of nowhere  20 years ago, and has since increased in numbers. </p>

<p>Their nature is extremely violent, and ever since their appearance, they have haunted and endangered the lives of many innocent civillians. </p>

<p>But all this was nothing compared to the events of 10 years ago, when the most feared of the Evils, Evil Disastia, was born. </p>

<p>This terrible monster lived up to its name and brought forth a major &quot;disaster&quot;,, causing the deaths of millions of people until its fall that very same year. </p>

<p>- Angels...</p>

<p>Beings with white wings, initially believed to be just a fantasy. </p>

<p>But the fantasy turns out to be reality, as there are recent sightings of child angels in the small village of Hawick. </p>

<p>These angels were found abandoned in the outskirts of Hawick as infants and the people of Hawick were kind-hearted to take them in. Hawick then became a haven for these &quot;infant angels&quot; under the care and protection of the villagers. </p>
<p>It is still a mystery as to where the infant angels come from, or why they have been abandoned. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lake Llandovery, wakes up in a room to find a doctor. And realizes he had fainted for some reasons. </p>

<p>The doctor, on coming to know of his status as the &quot;Evil Sweeper&quot;, makes a request to sweep off the wandering Evils in a nearby forest that poses a great threat to the small town of Turku. </p>

<p>Lake accepts his request and heads for the forest. </p>

<p>However...</p>

<p>　</p>

<p>A mysterious young boy by the name of Ende suddenly appears after Lake slayed the Evil tribe leader in the forest. </p>

<p>Ende summons  a menacing creature, Irmgard, that threatens to end Lake's life. </p>

<p>Just as all hope seems to be lost for Lake, </p>
<p>a blue-haired lady, with white wings fully sprouted, appears out of nowhere as she defeats Irmgard with ease, saving Lake's life in the process. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Shrouded mysteries, sneaky conspiracies and surrounding speculations. </p>
<p>Convictions that spread like wildfire  , and the determination to escape one's fate. </p>
<p>Just what lies ahead for Lake and the mysterious lady as they seek answers to the recent events? </p>
<p>　</p>
