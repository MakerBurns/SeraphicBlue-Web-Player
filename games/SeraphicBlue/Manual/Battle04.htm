<p><font size="2">As the game progresses, enemies gradually become tougher to beat and their attacks also become stronger. <br>
  As a result, battles which initially are smooth-sailing are no longer so and become more difficult to cope with.
<br>
 Therefore, here are some basic battle strategies and tips in managing tough enemy battles ahead.
</font></p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#004080">
    <tr>
        <td valign="bottom">Understand Enemy Data </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">Enemy Data shows all the attributes of an enemy, ranging from every individual stat to elemental and status weaknesses and resistances. This data is especially very beneficial to players as it helps them in handling tough enemies more easily like taking advantage of  the enemies' weaknesses and dealing the most amount of damage on them, and also 
knowing enemies' resistances so that they don't use the wrong moves.<br>
 Checking on Enemy Data is the most fundamental factor in helping players gain the important victory.

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#004080">
    <tr>
        <td valign="bottom">Pounce on Enemy's Weaknesses  </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">An enemy's elemental resistance is at its weakest when it is at 0. As explained above, players should hence take advantage of an enemy's elemental weakness and use the relevant elemental attack ability to deal the most amount of damage on the enemy, or equip the relevant elemental attack invest spheres to boost up the relevant elemental attack damage (applies to both physical and magical attacks). <br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#004080">
    <tr>
        <td valign="bottom">Cover up your Party's Elemental Weaknesses </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">Every individual character has different elemental resistances, be it being weak to an element or strong against an element. <br>
  Enemies may cast certain elemental attacks that one or more of your party members are weak to and this may 
cause an unfavourable battle situation as a result. <br>
 Hence to prevent this unfavourable situation from happening, players should strengthen up on their party's elemental resistances based on the situations if they find themselves dying too often due to elemental attacks, by equipping elemental-resistant Invest spheres. <br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#004080">
    <tr>
        <td valign="bottom">Inflict Enemies with Negative Status Effects </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">Unfortunately, negative status effects are useless on all bosses since all bosses are immune to all negative status effects.<br>
However, negative status effects do work on certain small-fry enemies, and will be very useful especially against small-fry enemies whom you commonly have trouble dealing with. <br>
Even the Level 1 Supportive debuff spells are  useful against some of the toughest and most annoying small-fry enemies in the final dungeon. <br>
 Negative status effects can deny enemies prone to them from casting their deadly spells on your party, hence giving you an easier time in fighting and defeating them. <br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#004080">
    <tr>
        <td valign="bottom">Boost your Party's Resistances to Negative Status Effects/Debuffs </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">One of the main reasons for a battle's downfall is due to annoying negative status effects inflicted on your party. <br>
  Do not underestimate the power of negative status effects, as these can cripple your party members and result in defeats. eg. Imagine a situation where all your party members are paralysed. What do you do then?
<br>
Hence it is very useful to raise resistances against negative status effects by equipping specific debuff-resistant Invest spheres.<br>
If multiple party members are inflicted with a status effect, it is always useful to buy debuff-heal items and extend them into thier All versions to utilise the All-heal effects of these items on your party members. <br>
<br>
※The best countermeasure against negative status effects is the 『All Green』 Tactical sphere, which can be bought from shops as the game progresses. 
<br>
This sphere, when equipped on a character, can heal all negative status effects on him when he gets his turn in battle while inflicted with negative status effects, for 5% of the character's total TP cost, which makes the All Green sphere the best asset to have in countering negative status effects. (Although this  doesn't work if the character is paralysed, dead or stoned).

  All enemy attacks are either physical or magical. So it would be ideal to strengthen up your party members DEF &amp; MDF so that your party members suffer lesser damage from enemies. Guard spheres help in adding further boosts to DEF and MDF besides frames. Shields and walls for the best DEF and helms and hats for the best MDF for your party members. <br>
<br>

In the case of elemental enemy attacks, it would be ideal to equip elemental-defense Invest spheres to your party members to reduce elemental damage dealt by enemy attacks.

 You can boost your characters' elemental physical attack damage as well by equipping them with multiple specific elemental-attack Invest spheres to pounce on your enemies' elemental weaknesses, allowing your characters to deal extreme damage to your enemies. <br>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">・Equip 『Concentration』 Sphere</font><font

At a certain point in the game, players will be able to buy the 『Concentration』 sphere from shops. <br>
This sphere boosts a character's magical damage of a magical ability by 1.5x for 2x the original TP cost of the respective magical ability, making it a great booster equipment for higher magical damage. <br>
<br>
</font><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">・Clever</font><font

Similarly to physical attacks, you can also boost your characters' elemental magical attack damage by equipping them with multiple specific elemental-attack Invest spheres to pounce on your enemies' elemental weaknesses, allowing your characters to deal extreme damage to your characters. This amount of magical damage is especially even greater with the Concentration spheres equipped to your characters.

    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">Most enemies' ultimate attacks that can kill your entire party require the cost of a field element (FE). <br>
  Hence it is very useful  to prevent enemies from using their FE ultimate abilities by using abilities or Invest spheres to get rid of the respective field elements, eg. Use water ability to neutralise the fire field element, use a dark-elemental attack Invest sphere to neutralise the light field element via a physical attack etc. <br>
  However, sky and shock elements do not have opposing elements and the only ways to get rid of them are either by using abilities that get rid of or use them, or by equipping Anti-Sky/Anti-Shock FE Alter invest spheres and using physical attacks to get rid of them.

    <tr>
        <td valign="bottom">Taking Advantage of your Party's FE attacks／Teamwork Play </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="2">Do take advantage of your party members' FE-cost abilities to pounce on your enemies' elemental weakneses, <br>
  as these abilities are much stronger than the normal elemental abilities and can help to kill your enemies faster. <br>
<br>
 In order to use FE abilities effectively, teamwork greatly comes into play.
<br>
 Since FE abilities can only be used if a field element is in play,
<br>
 how the teamwork works is that one character prepares a field element (the FE preparer) so that another character can cast an ability that requires that particular field element (the FE caster).
This is how FE abilities
can be used effectively. <br>
<br>
Various ways that the FE preparer can prepare a field element in play include casting a normal elemental attack (either physical or magical), or by equipping a FE summon invest sphere and then casting any attack. <br>
Go on and discover the infinite possibilities of teamwork play in FE to uncover the strongest combinations of attacks on the enemies. <br>

</table>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">・Observe Enemy's Attack Pattern </font><font
size="2"><br>
  Always observe enemies' attack patterns carefully, 
especially bosses. There may be times when the bosses at times may cast an attack that doesn't seem much, but suddenly follows up with an attack that kills your entire party. <br>
Hence do be prepared in advance and take the necessary measures to counter bosses' attacks before they get their turns.
<br>
An example would be when  bosses' attacks seem to just simply kill your whole party, do not be alarmed and think of ways to counter them. In every battle, including boss battles, there are definitely ways to counter bosses' ultimate attacks.  <br>
  <br>
  </font><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">・WT Gauge Check </font><font
size="2"><br>
  A stronger attack or a more effective ability will have a higher WT. <br>
  Hence, do strategise on which actions to take before performing them. Check on all your characters' and enemies' WT gauge positions and also take a look the AWT/ATKWT of the respective attacks, abilities etc before executing commands on your characters. <br>
  Do check on Enemy Data to check on the enemy's AGI/MOV so that you'll know how fast your enemy travels along the WT gauge from right to left as opposed to your characters. <br>
  Finally, it also helps to refer to WT Check to check your characters' and enemies' current WT gauge positions when one of your characters gets a turn, so from there you can then strategise your next moves. <br>
