<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">◆Character View when Selecting Equipments </font><font
size="2"><br>
  When buying equipments, players can check if a certain character can equip a certain equipment by looking at the character sprite at the bottom left of the Buy menu. A walking animation will indicate that the character is able to equip a highlighted equipment. </font><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><br clear="all">
</font><font size="2">Players can switch between characters by pressing Shift. (Don't press Shift too many times to avoid the StickKeys stiuation.) <br>
<br>
 Highlighting a weapon or a frame
</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2">will display stat changes to a characterif the weapon or frame is to be equipped to the character. <br clear="all">
</font><font size="2">If a stat acronym (ATK, HIT etc) turns red, it is an increase in that particular stat. The opposite is true if the stat acronym turns dark blue. <br>
 Spheres with stat boosts, however, do not display any stat changes if you highlight them.
<br>
 This is because all the spheres with stat boosts specifically state which stats are boosted in their descriptions.
<br>
 To see the exact stat changes for a new equipment, players can highlight the new equipment while equipping characters in the Equipment menu.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">◆Discount System </font><font
size="2"><br>
  Prices of items are discounted if players buy 10 or more of the same items.
</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><br clear="all">
</font><font size="2">Higher discounts are given for more of the same items bought, so it would be more economical to buy more of the same items at the same time than buy the same number of items on separate occasions. <br>
The discount system, however, does not apply to equipments.<br>
 The discount system is especially very useful for eg. Extending where players can buy a large amount of Source items for high discounts to produce a </font>high amount of All/Double-effect items, which is cheaper than buying the same amount on separate occasions.</p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">◆Item Lineup／Game Progression Changes </font><font
size="2"><br>
    New items may be updated to the shops' items lineup if players sell exceedingly large amounts of items  and visit the shops on another occasion. <br>
 All shops in the world of Seraphic Blue sell the same universal items, so all shops will be updated with the exact same items.
<br>
The shops' items lineups are also updated to the next level as the game progresses (New places to visit, new storyline development etc).<br>
 Hence be sure to check the shops on a regular basis for any new updates.
