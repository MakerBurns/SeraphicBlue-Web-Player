 All units move from right to left, and how fast they move is dependant on their AGI stat, and whether they are any debuffs affecting their AGI.

        The rate of Surprise attacks occuring depends on how high the enemy party's combined MOV stats are in comparison with your party's combined MOV stats. <br>
      Surprise attacks are especially more dangerous during the latter half of the game, where enemies are much stronger and can kill your party via surprise attacks before you can even react, so it is very important to have high MOV stats to prevent any surprise attacks. </font></td>

        The unique feature here in Seraphic Blue is that, unlike most RPGs where dead and stoned party members do not gain any EXP after a battle victory, dead and stoned party members in Seraphic Blue still gain the same amount of EXP as the alive party members after a battle victory.

<p><font size="2">Players do not gain anything from battles if they escape from them. This is a custom that is present in all RPGs. <br>
  This is true even if you participate in a battle and midway through the battle, you decide not to complete it and escape.
<br>
The significance of this antithesis is what is known as the 「Victory or Defeat」 battle policy. <br>
 The conclusion of a battle is not determined by how many are left standing or how many have fallen.
<br>
As long as all enemies on the battlefield are defeated, your party is victorious, and it would be Game Over if all your party members are dead or stoned. So the end result of a battle is always either Victory or Defeat. An escape doesn't count as an end result. <br>

</table>

<p><font size="2">The difficulty of battles in most RPGs these days are relatively too easy. Most enemies in these RPGs are just not up to the challenging level standard of difficulty and hardly any strategy is involved in defeating them. <br>
Therefore I've designed all enemy battles in such a way that they are challenging but not too hard, and require utmost strategies to defeat the enemies, even normal ones. (Not just mere hack and slash). <br>
<br>
 For that, battles in Seraphic Blue are no pushovers.
<br>
 All battles are challenging, but not to the point where they are not defeatable either.
<br>
 Players have to think carefully of their every move before execution.
<br>
 This is the nature of strategic battles in Seraphic Blue.
<br>
<br>
The outcome of a battle is not determined by which side has the upper hand, ie. enemy party has little HP left compared to ally party.<br>
In most RPGs, even if your party is close to winning, you can still be defeated unexpectedly by the enemy, which is why players should never underestimate any battles. <br>
 Hence gaining victory in battles requires concentration and good strategy-planning, and not mindless attacking on the enemies. </font></p>
